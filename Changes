    - Require Perl v5.10+
    - Fixed warnings in tests
    - Fix sublist attribute type encoding

    - Added support for Status-Server requests (RFC 5997)
    - Added support for IPv6 (RFC 3162)
    - Added support for integer64 type (RFC 6929)
    - Fixed warning of using uninitialized value $vendor_name (RT 99161)

      at least one of the nodes in node list did not listen on

      to set timeout in floating seconds since the epoch)

0.23 Sat Aug 17 21:48:00 2013

        Will LaSala and Robert Tuttle for the problem report
        and patches)
    - Include NAS-IP-Address into the check_pwd to avoid error
        "non-RFC packet error" from some of the RADIUS servers (Thanks

        long time.
